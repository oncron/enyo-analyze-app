Analyze Enyo Applications
=========================

## Overview

This perl script analyzes a minified Enyo 2.x app (app.js, for example) and outputs a report of modules, sorted by minified size.  This can help to locate bloated modules and unexpected inclusions.

## Usage

$ perl analyzeEnyoApp.pl app.js
